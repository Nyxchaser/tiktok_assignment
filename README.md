This is a completed backend assignment for the 2023 Tiktok Tech Immersion Programme.

## About the Project

This project involves the design and development of the backend side of an IM (Instant Messaging) system implementing a set of specific APIs using Golang. It focuses on core message features without the front-end part and the account/authentication part. The IDE used is Goland, by Jetbrains. I am using the educational license, which gives me free access to the IDE for as long as I am a student. For more information about Goland, check out this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/go/.

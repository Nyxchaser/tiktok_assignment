This is a completed backend assignment for the 2023 Tiktok Tech Immersion Programme.

## About the Project

This project involves the design and development of the backend side of an IM (Instant Messaging) system implementing a set of specific APIs using Golang. It focuses on core message features without the front-end part and the account/authentication part. 

## Tools Used:
* The IDE used is Goland, by Jetbrains. I am using the educational license, which gives me free access to the IDE for as long as I am a student. 
- For more information about Goland, check out this [link](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/).
* Kitex is a Golang-based RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework developed by Xiaomi used to build the rpc-server in this project.
* Hertz is another Golang-based framework developed by JD.com used to build the http-server in this project.

## Highlights
### Lessons
* Learnt how to use Docker
* Learnt about the difference between CRLF and LF
- Check out a common headache faced when using Docker for Windows [here](https://willi.am/blog/2016/08/11/docker-for-windows-dealing-with-windows-line-endings/)
* Learnt how to perform testing using Postman and JMeter

### Challenges
* It was hard trying to understand Docker and working with it on Windows
* I was fairly new to Git and made a lot of blunders (including accidentally sending a pull request to the original TikTok repo, it might still be there)
* I am still trying to understand how the different servers interact with each other

### Favourite Parts
* I loved seeing the Docker servers turn green to show that they are working.
* I enjoyed seeing my commits reflected real-time in Github.
* It was fun learning together with so many people and making new connections.

## Credits:
I'd like to thank everyone in the Tiktok Immersion Programme for their contribution to my learning, especially:
* The instructors who have taken the time and effort to conduct lessons, prepare the slides and explain to us difficult concepts within a tight timeline.
* My fellow learners who helped with debugging my code when things went wrong and errors stopped me from completing the project.
* Weixing, whose guide provided the necessary steps for me to understand and complete the project step-by-step.
* The Github & StackOverflow forum contributors who helped me to understand and resolve many complex errors I've ecountered.
